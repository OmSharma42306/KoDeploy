# 🚀 [] – A Vercel-Like Deployment Platform

A learning-focused project where I build a simplified version of **Vercel**, the popular frontend cloud platform for developers. This project aims to help me understand and implement the core concepts behind modern CI/CD, serverless deployment, and edge infrastructure.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Recreate core functionality similar to Vercel:
  - Git-based auto-deployments
  - Serverless function support
  - Custom domain routing
  - Edge deployment (experimental)
  - Static site hosting (e.g., Next.js, React)
- Build full-stack infrastructure from scratch
- Learn about:
  - Docker, Kubernetes (optional)
  - CI/CD pipelines
  - File systems and caching
  - DNS and TLS management
  - Scalable architecture patterns
